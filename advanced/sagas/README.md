# Using Sagas

The ability to ochestrate a series of events is a powerful feature, and MassTransit makes this possible.

A saga is a long-lived transaction managed by a coordinator. Sagas are initiated by an event, 
sagas orchestrate events, and sagas maintain the state of the overall transaction. 
Sagas are designed to manage the complexity of a distributed transaction without locking and 
immediate consistency. They manage state and track any compensations required if a partial failure occurs.

We didnâ€™t create it, we learned it from the [original Cornell paper][1] and from Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz's [description][2].
