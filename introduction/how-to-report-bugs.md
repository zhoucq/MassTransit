# How to report bugs

MassTransit can be a tricky beast to debug, with a multi-threaded system,
trying to track down the issue can be a bit painful.

So if you run into a bug, please spend a minute collecting the right information
to help us fix the bug.

The most valuable piece of information you can give us, is always give us a failing
unit test, if you can't give us that then how to reproduce the bug in a step by
step fashion. Other wise its going to be a lot of back and forth until we can
better understand and get to a failing unit test.
